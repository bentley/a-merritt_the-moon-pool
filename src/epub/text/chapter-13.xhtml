<P>
"You'd better have this handy, Doc." O'Keefe paused at the head of the
stairway and handed me one of the automatics he had taken from
Marakinoff.
</P>

<P>
"Shall I not have one also?" rather anxiously asked the latter.
</P>

<P>
"When you need it you'll get it," answered O'Keefe.  "I'll tell you
frankly, though, Professor, that you'll have to show me before I trust
you with a gun. You shoot too straight&mdash;from cover."
</P>

<P>
The flash of anger in the Russian's eyes turned to a cold
consideration.
</P>

<P>
"You say always just what is in your mind, Lieutenant O'Keefe," he
mused. "Da&mdash;that I shall remember!" Later I was to recall this odd
observation&mdash;and Marakinoff was to remember indeed.
</P>

<P>
In single file, O'Keefe at the head and Olaf bringing up the rear, we
passed through the portal. Before us dropped a circular shaft, into
which the light from the chamber of the oval streamed liquidly; set in
its sides the steps spiralled, and down them we went, cautiously. The
stairway ended in a circular well; silent&mdash;with no trace of exit! The
rounded stones joined each other evenly&mdash;hermetically. Carved on one
of the slabs was one of the five flowered vines. I pressed my fingers
upon the calyxes, even as Larry had within the Moon Chamber.
</P>

<P>
A crack&mdash;horizontal, four feet wide&mdash;appeared on the wall; widened,
and as the sinking slab that made it dropped to the level of our eyes,
we looked through a hundred-feet-long rift in the living rock! The
stone fell steadily&mdash;and we saw that it was a Cyclopean wedge set
within the slit of the passageway. It reached the level of our feet
and stopped. At the far end of this tunnel, whose floor was the
polished rock that had, a moment before, fitted hermetically into its
roof, was a low, narrow triangular opening through which light
streamed.
</P>

<P>
"Nowhere to go but out!" grinned Larry.  "And I'll bet Golden Eyes is
waiting for us with a taxi!" He stepped forward. We followed,
slipping, sliding along the glassy surface; and I, for one, had a
lively apprehension of what our fate would be should that enormous
mass rise before we had emerged! We reached the end; crept out of the
narrow triangle that was its exit.
</P>

<P>
We stood upon a wide ledge carpeted with a thick yellow moss.  I
looked behind&mdash;and clutched O'Keefe's arm. The door through which we
had come had vanished! There was only a precipice of pale rock, on
whose surfaces great patches of the amber moss hung; around whose base
our ledge ran, and whose summits, if summits it had, were hidden, like
the luminous cliffs, in the radiance above us.
</P>

<P>
"Nowhere to go but ahead&mdash;and Golden Eyes hasn't kept her date!"
laughed O'Keefe&mdash;but somewhat grimly.
</P>

<P>
We walked a few yards along the ledge and, rounding a corner, faced
the end of one of the slender bridges. From this vantage point the
oddly shaped vehicles were plain, and we could see they were, indeed,
like the shell of the Nautilus and elfinly beautiful. Their drivers
sat high upon the forward whorl. Their bodies were piled high with
cushions, upon which lay women half-swathed in gay silken webs. From
the pavilioned gardens smaller channels of glistening green ran into
the broad way, much as automobile runways do on earth; and in and out
of them flashed the fairy shells.
</P>

<P>
There came a shout from one.  Its occupants had glimpsed us. They
pointed; others stopped and stared; one shell turned and sped up a
runway&mdash;and quickly over the other side of the bridge came a score of
men. They were dwarfed&mdash;none of them more than five feet high,
prodigiously broad of shoulder, clearly enormously powerful.
</P>

<P>
"Trolde!" muttered Olaf, stepping beside O'Keefe, pistol swinging free
in his hand.
</P>

<P>
But at the middle of the bridge the leader stopped, waved back his
men, and came toward us alone, palms outstretched in the immemorial,
universal gesture of truce. He paused, scanning us with manifest
wonder; we returned the scrutiny with interest. The dwarf's face was
as white as Olaf's&mdash;far whiter than those of the other three of us;
the features clean-cut and noble, almost classical; the wide set eyes
of a curious greenish grey and the black hair curling over his head
like that on some old Greek statue.
</P>

<P>
Dwarfed though he was, there was no suggestion of deformity about him.
The gigantic shoulders were covered with a loose green tunic that
looked like fine linen. It was caught in at the waist by a broad
girdle studded with what seemed to be amazonites. In it was thrust a
long curved poniard resembling the Malaysian kris. His legs were
swathed in the same green cloth as the upper garment. His feet were
sandalled.
</P>

<P>
My gaze returned to his face, and in it I found something subtly
disturbing; an expression of half-malicious gaiety that underlay the
wholly prepossessing features like a vague threat; a mocking deviltry
that hinted at entire callousness to suffering or sorrow; something of
the spirit that was vaguely alien and disquieting.
</P>

<P>
He spoke&mdash;and, to my surprise, enough of the words were familiar to
enable me clearly to catch the meaning of the whole. They were
Polynesian, the Polynesian of the Samoans which is its most ancient
form, but in some indefinable way&mdash;archaic. Later I was to know that
the tongue bore the same relation to the Polynesian of today as does
<I>not</I> that of Chaucer, but of the Venerable Bede, to modern English.
Nor was this to be so astonishing, when with the knowledge came the
certainty that it was from it the language we call Polynesian sprang.
</P>

<P>
"From whence do you come, strangers&mdash;and how found you your way here?"
said the green dwarf.
</P>

<P>
I waved my hand toward the cliff behind us.  His eyes narrowed
incredulously; he glanced at its drop, upon which even a mountain goat
could not have made its way, and laughed.
</P>

<P>
"We came through the rock," I answered his thought. "And we come in
peace," I added.
</P>

<P>
"And may peace walk with you," he said half-derisively&mdash;"if the
Shining One wills it!"
</P>

<P>
He considered us again.
</P>

<P>
"Show me, strangers, where you came through the rock," he commanded.
We led the way to where we had emerged from the well of the stairway.
</P>

<P>
"It was here," I said, tapping the cliff.
</P>

<P>
"But I see no opening," he said suavely.
</P>

<P>
"It closed behind us," I answered; and then, for the first time,
realized how incredible the explanation sounded. The derisive gleam
passed through his eyes again. But he drew his poniard and gravely
sounded the rock.
</P>

<P>
"You give a strange turn to our speech," he said.  "It sounds
strangely, indeed&mdash;as strange as your answers." He looked at us
quizzically. "I wonder where you learned it! Well, all that you can
explain to the Afyo Maie." His head bowed and his arms swept out in a
wide salaam. "Be pleased to come with me!" he ended abruptly.
</P>

<P>
"In peace?" I asked.
</P>

<P>
"In peace," he replied&mdash;then slowly&mdash;"with me at least."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, come on, Doc!" cried Larry.  "As long as we're here let's see the
sights. Allons mon vieux!" he called gaily to the green dwarf. The
latter, understanding the spirit, if not the words, looked at O'Keefe
with a twinkle of approval; turned then to the great Norseman and
scanned him with admiration; reached out and squeezed one of the
immense biceps.
</P>

<P>
"Lugur will welcome you, at least," he murmured as though to himself.
He stood aside and waved a hand courteously, inviting us to pass. We
crossed. At the base of the span one of the elfin shells was waiting.
</P>

<P>
Beyond, scores had gathered, their occupants evidently discussing us
in much excitement. The green dwarf waved us to the piles of cushions
and then threw himself beside us. The vehicle started off smoothly,
the now silent throng making way, and swept down the green roadway at
a terrific pace and wholly without vibration, toward the
seven-terraced tower.
</P>

<P>
As we flew along I tried to discover the source of the power, but I
could not&mdash;then. There was no sign of mechanism, but that the shell
responded to some form of energy was certain&mdash;the driver grasping a
small lever which seemed to control not only our speed, but our
direction.
</P>

<P>
We turned abruptly and swept up a runway through one of the gardens,
and stopped softly before a pillared pavilion. I saw now that these
were much larger than I had thought. The structure to which we had
been carried covered, I estimated, fully an acre. Oblong, with its
slender, vari-coloured columns spaced regularly, its walls were like
the sliding screens of the Japanese&mdash;shoji.
</P>

<P>
The green dwarf hurried us up a flight of broad steps flanked by great
carved serpents, winged and scaled. He stamped twice upon mosaicked
stones between two of the pillars, and a screen rolled aside,
revealing an immense hall scattered about with low divans on which
lolled a dozen or more of the dwarfish men, dressed identically as he.
</P>

<P>
They sauntered up to us leisurely; the surprised interest in their
faces tempered by the same inhumanly gay malice that seemed to be
characteristic of all these people we had as yet seen.
</P>

<P>
"The Afyo Maie awaits them, Rador," said one.
</P>

<P>
The green dwarf nodded, beckoned us, and led the way through the great
hall and into a smaller chamber whose far side was covered with the
opacity I had noted from the aerie of the cliff. I examined
the&mdash;blackness&mdash;with lively interest.
</P>

<P>
It had neither substance nor texture; it was not matter&mdash;and yet it
suggested solidity; an entire cessation, a complete absorption of
light; an ebon veil at once immaterial and palpable. I stretched,
involuntarily, my hand out toward it, and felt it quickly drawn back.
</P>

<P>
"Do you seek your end so soon?" whispered Rador.  "But I forget&mdash;you
do not know," he added. "On your life touch not the blackness, ever.
It&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
He stopped, for abruptly in the density a portal appeared; swinging
out of the shadow like a picture thrown by a lantern upon a screen.
Through it was revealed a chamber filled with a soft rosy glow. Rising
from cushioned couches, a woman and a man regarded us, half leaning
over a long, low table of what seemed polished jet, laden with flowers
and unfamiliar fruits.
</P>

<P>
About the room&mdash;that part of it, at least, that I could see&mdash;were a
few oddly shaped chairs of the same substance. On high, silvery
tripods three immense globes stood, and it was from them that the rose
glow emanated. At the side of the woman was a smaller globe whose
roseate gleam was tempered by quivering waves of blue.
</P>

<P>
"Enter Rador with the strangers!" a clear, sweet voice called.
</P>

<P>
Rador bowed deeply and stood aside, motioning us to pass.  We entered,
the green dwarf behind us, and out of the corner of my eye I saw the
doorway fade as abruptly as it had appeared and again the dense shadow
fill its place.
</P>

<P>
"Come closer, strangers.  Be not afraid!" commanded the bell-toned
voice.
</P>

<P>
We approached.
</P>

<P>
The woman, sober scientist that I am, made the breath catch in my
throat. Never had I seen a woman so beautiful as was Yolara of the
Dweller's city&mdash;and none of so perilous a beauty. Her hair was of the
colour of the young tassels of the corn and coiled in a regal crown
above her broad, white brows; her wide eyes were of grey that could
change to a cornflower blue and in anger deepen to purple; grey or
blue, they had little laughing devils within them, but when the storm
of anger darkened them&mdash;they were not laughing, no! The silken webs
that half covered, half revealed her did not hide the ivory whiteness
of her flesh nor the sweet curve of shoulders and breasts. But for all
her amazing beauty, she was&mdash;sinister! There was cruelty about the
curving mouth, and in the music of her voice&mdash;not conscious cruelty,
but the more terrifying, careless cruelty of nature itself.
</P>

<P>
The girl of the rose wall had been beautiful, yes!  But her beauty was
human, understandable. You could imagine her with a babe in her
arms&mdash;but you could not so imagine this woman. About her loveliness
hovered something unearthly. A sweet feminine echo of the Dweller was
Yolara, the Dweller's priestess&mdash;and as gloriously, terrifyingly evil!
</P>
