</h2>

<P>
There was a little silence.  I looked upon him with wonder. Clearly he
was in deepest earnest. I know the psychology of the Gael is a curious
one and that deep in all their hearts their ancient traditions and
beliefs have strong and living roots. And I was both amused and
touched.
</P>

<P>
Here was this soldier, who had faced war and its ugly realities
open-eyed and fearless, picking, indeed, the most dangerous branch of
service for his own, a modern if ever there was one, appreciative of
most unmystical Broadway, and yet soberly and earnestly attesting to
his belief in banshee, in shadowy people of the woods, and phantom
harpers! I wondered what he would think if he could see the Dweller
and then, with a pang, that perhaps his superstitions might make him
an easy prey.
</P>

<P>
He shook his head half impatiently and ran a hand over his eyes;
turned to me and grinned:
</P>

<P>
"Don't think I'm cracked, Professor," he said.  "I'm not. But it takes
me that way now and then. It's the Irish in me. And, believe it or
not, I'm telling you the truth."
</P>

<P>
I looked eastward where the moon, now nearly a week past the full, was
mounting.
</P>

<P>
"You can't make me see what you've seen, Lieutenant," I laughed.  "But
you can make me hear. I've always wondered what kind of a noise a
disembodied spirit could make without any vocal cords or breath or any
other earthly sound-producing mechanism. How does the banshee sound?"
</P>

<P>
O'Keefe looked at me seriously.
</P>

<P>
"All right," he said.  "I'll show you." From deep down in his throat
came first a low, weird sobbing that mounted steadily into a keening
whose mournfulness made my skin creep. And then his hand shot out and
gripped my shoulder, and I stiffened like stone in my chair&mdash;for from
behind us, like an echo, and then taking up the cry, swelled a wail
that seemed to hold within it a sublimation of the sorrows of
centuries! It gathered itself into one heartbroken, sobbing note and
died away! O'Keefe's grip loosened, and he rose swiftly to his feet.
</P>

<P>
"It's all right, Professor," he said.  "It's for me.  It found me&mdash;all
this way from Ireland."
</P>

<P>
Again the silence was rent by the cry.  But now I had located it.  It
came from my room, and it could mean only one thing&mdash;Huldricksson had
wakened.
</P>

<P>
"Forget your banshee!" I gasped, and made a jump for the cabin.
</P>

<P>
Out of the corner of my eye I noted a look of half-sheepish relief
flit over O'Keefe's face, and then he was beside me. Da Costa shouted
an order from the wheel, the Cantonese ran up and took it from his
hands and the little Portuguese pattered down toward us. My hand on
the door, ready to throw it open, I stopped. What if the Dweller were
within&mdash;what if we had been wrong and it was not dependent for its
power upon that full flood of moon ray which Throckmartin had thought
essential to draw it from the blue pool!
</P>

<P>
From within, the sobbing wail began once more to rise. O'Keefe pushed
me aside, threw open the door and crouched low within it. I saw an
automatic flash dully in his hand; saw it cover the cabin from side to
side, following the swift sweep of his eyes around it. Then he
straightened and his face, turned toward the berth, was filled with
wondering pity.
</P>

<P>
Through the window streamed a shaft of the moonlight. It fell upon
Huldricksson's staring eyes; in them great tears slowly gathered and
rolled down his cheeks; from his opened mouth came the woe-laden
wailing. I ran to the port and drew the curtains. Da Costa snapped the
lights.
</P>

<P>
The Norseman's dolorous crying stopped as abruptly as though cut.  His
gaze rolled toward us. And at one bound he broke through the leashes I
had buckled round him and faced us, his eyes glaring, his yellow hair
almost erect with the force of the rage visibly surging through him.
Da Costa shrunk behind me. O'Keefe, coolly watchful, took a quick step
that brought him in front of me.
</P>

<P>
"Where do you take me?" said Huldricksson, and his voice was like the
growl of a beast. "Where is my boat?"
</P>

<P>
I touched O'Keefe gently and stood before the giant.
</P>

<P>
"Listen, Olaf Huldricksson," I said.  "We take you to where the
sparkling devil took your Helma and your Freda. We follow the
sparkling devil that came down from the moon. Do you hear me?" I spoke
slowly, distinctly, striving to pierce the mists that I knew swirled
around the strained brain. And the words did pierce.
</P>

<P>
He thrust out a shaking hand.
</P>

<P>
"You say you follow?" he asked falteringly.  "You know where to
follow? Where it took my Helma and my little Freda?"
</P>

<P>
"Just that, Olaf Huldricksson," I answered.  "Just that!  I pledge you
my life that I know."
</P>

<P>
Da Costa stepped forward.  "He speaks true, Olaf.  You go faster on
the Suwarna than on the Br-rw-un'ilda, Olaf, yes."
</P>

<P>
The giant Norseman, still gripping my hand, looked at him.  "I know
you, Da Costa," he muttered. "You are all right. Ja! You are a fair
man. Where is the Brunhilda?"
</P>

<P>
"She follow be'ind on a big rope, Olaf," soothed the Portuguese.
"Soon you see her. But now lie down an' tell us, if you can, why you
tie yourself to your wheel an' what it is that happen, Olaf."
</P>

<P>
"If you'll tell us how the sparkling devil came it will help us all
when we get to where it is, Huldricksson," I said.
</P>

<P>
On O'Keefe's face there was an expression of well-nigh ludicrous doubt
and amazement. He glanced from one to the other. The giant shifted his
own tense look from me to the Irishman. A gleam of approval lighted in
his eyes. He loosed me, and gripped O'Keefe's arm. "Staerk!" he said.
"Ja&mdash;strong, and with a strong heart. A man&mdash;ja! He comes too&mdash;we
shall need him&mdash;ja!"
</P>

<P>
"I tell," he muttered, and seated himself on the side of the bunk.
"It was four nights ago. My Freda"&mdash;his voice shook&mdash;"Mine Yndling!
She loved the moonlight. I was at the wheel and my Freda and my Helma
they were behind me. The moon was behind us and the Brunhilda was like
a swanboat sailing down with the moonlight sending her, ja.
</P>

<P>
"I heard my Freda say: 'I see a nisse coming down the track of the
moon.' And I hear her mother laugh, low, like a mother does when her
Yndling dreams. I was happy&mdash;that night&mdash;with my Helma and my Freda,
and the Brunhilda sailing like a swan-boat, ja. I heard the child say,
'The nisse comes fast!' And then I heard a scream from my Helma, a
great scream&mdash;like a mare when her foal is torn from her. I spun
around fast, ja! I dropped the wheel and spun fast! I saw&mdash;" He
covered his eyes with his hands.
</P>

<P>
The Portuguese had crept close to me, and I heard him panting like a
frightened dog.
</P>

<P>
"I saw a white fire spring over the rail," whispered Olaf
Huldricksson. "It whirled round and round, and it shone like&mdash;like
stars in a whirlwind mist. There was a noise in my ears. It sounded
like bells&mdash;little bells, ja! Like the music you make when you run
your finger round goblets. It made me sick and dizzy&mdash;the hell noise.
</P>

<P>
"My Helma was&mdash;indeholde&mdash;what you say&mdash;in the middle of the white
fire. She turned her face to me and she turned it on the child, and my
Helma's face burned into my heart. Because it was full of fear, and it
was full of happiness&mdash;of glaede. I tell you that the fear in my
Helma's face made me ice here"&mdash;he beat his breast with clenched
hand&mdash;"but the happiness in it burned on me like fire. And I could
not move&mdash;I could not move.
</P>

<P>
"I said in here"&mdash;he touched his head&mdash;"I said, 'It is Loki come out
of Helvede. But he cannot take my Helma, for Christ lives and Loki has
no power to hurt my Helma or my Freda! Christ lives! Christ lives!' I
said. But the sparkling devil did not let my Helma go. It drew her to
the rail; half over it. I saw her eyes upon the child and a little she
broke away and reached to it. And my Freda jumped into her arms. And
the fire wrapped them both and they were gone! A little I saw them
whirling on the moon track behind the Brunhilda&mdash;and they were gone!
</P>

<P>
"The sparkling devil took them!  Loki was loosed, and he had power.  I
turned the Brunhilda, and I followed where my Helma and mine Yndling
had gone. My boys crept up and asked me to turn again. But I would
not. They dropped a boat and left me. I steered straight on the path.
I lashed my hands to the wheel that sleep might not loose them. I
steered on and on and on&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Where was the God I prayed when my wife and child were taken?" cried
Olaf Huldricksson&mdash;and it was as though I heard Throckmartin asking
that same bitter question. "I have left Him as He left me, ja! I pray
now to Thor and to Odin, who can fetter Loki." He sank back, covering
again his eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Olaf," I said, "what you have called the sparkling devil has taken
ones dear to me. I, too, was following it when we found you. You shall
go with me to its home, and there we will try to take from it your
wife and your child and my friends as well. But now that you may be
strong for what is before us, you must sleep again."
</P>

<P>
Olaf Huldricksson looked upon me and in his eyes was that something
which souls must see in the eyes of Him the old Egyptians called the
Searcher of Hearts in the Judgment Hall of Osiris.
</P>

<P>
"You speak truth!" he said at last slowly.  "I will do what you say!"
</P>

<P>
He stretched out an arm at my bidding.  I gave him a second injection.
He lay back and soon he was sleeping. I turned toward Da Costa. His
face was livid and sweating, and he was trembling pitiably. O'Keefe
stirred.
</P>

<P>
"You did that mighty well, Dr. Goodwin," he said.  "So well that I
almost believed you myself."
</P>

<P>
"What did you think of his story, Mr. O'Keefe?" I asked.
</P>

<P>
His answer was almost painfully brief and colloquial.
</P>

<P>
"Nuts!" he said. I was a little shocked, I admit. "I think he's crazy,
Dr. Goodwin," he corrected himself, quickly. "What else could I
think?"
</P>

<P>
I turned to the little Portuguese without answering.
</P>

<P>
"There's no need for any anxiety tonight, Captain," I said. "Take my
word for it. You need some rest yourself. Shall I give you a sleeping
draft?"
</P>

<P>
"I do wish you would, Dr. Goodwin, sair," he answered gratefully.
"Tomorrow, when I feel bettair&mdash;I would have a talk with you."
</P>

<P>
I nodded.  He did know something then!  I mixed him an opiate of
considerable strength. He took it and went to his own cabin.
</P>

<P>
I locked the door behind him and then, sitting beside the sleeping
Norseman, I told O'Keefe my story from end to end. He asked few
questions as I spoke. But after I had finished he cross-examined me
rather minutely upon my recollections of the radiant phases upon each
appearance, checking these with Throckmartin's observations of the
same phenomena in the Chamber of the Moon Pool.
</P>

<P>
"And now what do you think of it all?" I asked.
</P>

<P>
He sat silent for a while, looking at Huldricksson.
</P>

<P>
"Not what you seem to think, Dr. Goodwin," he answered at last,
gravely. "Let me sleep over it. One thing of course is certain&mdash;you
and your friend Throckmartin and this man here saw&mdash;something. But&mdash;"
he was silent again and then continued with a kindness that I found
vaguely irritating&mdash;"but I've noticed that when a scientist gets
superstitious it&mdash;er&mdash;takes very hard!
</P>

<P>
"Here's a few things I can tell you now though," he went on while I
struggled to speak&mdash;"I pray in my heart that we'll meet neither the
Dolphin nor anything with wireless on board going up. Because, Dr.
Goodwin, I'd dearly love to take a crack at your Dweller.
</P>

<P>
"And another thing," said O'Keefe.  "After this&mdash;cut out the
trimmings, Doc, and call me plain Larry, for whether I think you're
crazy or whether I don't, you're there with the nerve, Professor, and
I'm for <I>you</I>.
</P>

<P>
"Good night!" said Larry and took himself out to the deck hammock he
had insisted upon having slung for him, refusing the captain's
importunities to use his own cabin.
</P>

<P>
And it was with extremely mixed emotions as to his compliment that I
watched him go. Superstitious. I, whose pride was my scientific
devotion to fact and fact alone! Superstitious&mdash;and this from a man
who believed in banshees and ghostly harpers and Irish wood nymphs and
no doubt in leprechauns and all their tribe!
</P>

<P>
Half laughing, half irritated, and wholly happy in even the part
promise of Larry O'Keefe's comradeship on my venture, I arranged a
couple of pillows, stretched myself out on two chairs and took up my
vigil beside Olaf Huldricksson.
</P>
