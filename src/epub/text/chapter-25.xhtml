<P>
The arch was closer&mdash;and in my awe I forgot for the moment Larry and
aught else. For this was no rainbow, no thing born of light and mist,
no Bifrost Bridge of myth&mdash;no! It was a flying arch of stone, stained
with flares of Tyrian purples, of royal scarlets, of blues dark as the
Gulf Stream's ribbon, sapphires soft as midday May skies, splashes of
chromes and greens&mdash;a palette of giantry, a bridge of wizardry; a
hundred, nay, a thousand, times greater than that of Utah which the
Navaho call Nonnegozche and worship, as well they may, as a god, and
which is itself a rainbow in eternal rock.
</P>

<P>
It sprang from the ledge and winged its prodigious length in one low
arc over the sea's crimson breast, as though in some ancient paroxysm
of earth it had been hurled molten, crystallizing into that stupendous
span and still flaming with the fires that had moulded it.
</P>

<P>
Closer we came and closer, while I watched spellbound; now we were at
its head, and the litter-bearers swept upon it. All of five hundred
feet wide it was, surface smooth as a city road, sides low walled,
curving inward as though in the jetting-out of its making the edges of
the plastic rock had curled.
</P>

<P>
On and on we sped; the high thrusting precipices upon which the
bridge's far end rested, frowned close; the enigmatic, dully shining
dome loomed ever greater. Now we had reached that end; were passing
over a smooth plaza whose level floor was enclosed, save for a rift in
front of us, by the fanged tops of the black cliffs.
</P>

<P>
From this rift stretched another span, half a mile long, perhaps,
widening at its centre into a broad platform, continuing straight to
two massive gates set within the face of the second cliff wall like
panels, and of the same dull gold as the dome rising high beyond. And
this smaller arch leaped a pit, an abyss, of which the outer
precipices were the rim holding back from the pit the red flood.
</P>

<P>
We were rapidly approaching; now upon the platform; my bearers were
striding closely along the side; I leaned far out&mdash;a giddiness seized
me! I gazed down into depth upon vertiginous depth; an abyss
indeed&mdash;an abyss dropping to world's base like that in which the
Babylonians believed writhed Talaat, the serpent mother of Chaos; a
pit that struck down into earth's heart itself.
</P>

<P>
Now, what was that&mdash;distance upon unfathomable distance below?  A
stupendous glowing like the green fire of life itself. What was it
like? I had it! It was like the corona of the sun in eclipse&mdash;that
burgeoning that makes of our luminary when moon veils it an incredible
blossoming of splendours in the black heavens.
</P>

<P>
And strangely, strangely, it was like the Dweller's beauty when with
its dazzling spirallings and writhings it raced amid its storm of
crystal bell sounds!
</P>

<P>
The abyss was behind us; we had paused at the golden portals; they
swung inward. A wide corridor filled with soft light was before us,
and on its threshold stood&mdash;bizarre, yellow gems gleaming, huge muzzle
wide in what was evidently meant for a smile of welcome&mdash;the woman
frog of the Moon Pool wall.
</P>

<P>
Lakla raised her head; swept back the silken tent of her hair and
gazed at me with eyes misty from weeping. The frog-woman crept to her
side; gazed down upon Larry; spoke&mdash;<I>spoke</I>&mdash;to the Golden Girl in a
swift stream of the sonorous, reverberant monosyllables; and Lakla
answered her in kind. The webbed digits swept over O'Keefe's face,
felt at his heart; she shook her head and moved ahead of us up the
passage.
</P>

<P>
Still borne in the litters we went on, winding, ascending until at
last they were set down in a great hall carpeted with soft fragrant
rushes and into which from high narrow slits streamed the crimson
light from without.
</P>

<P>
I jumped over to Larry, there had been no change in his condition;
still the terrifying limpness, the slow, infrequent pulsation. Rador
and Olaf&mdash;and the fever now seemed to be gone from him&mdash;came and stood
beside me, silent.
</P>

<P>
"I go to the Three," said Lakla.  "Wait you here."  She passed through
a curtaining; then as swiftly as she had gone she returned through the
hangings, tresses braided, a swathing of golden gauze about her.
</P>

<P>
"Rador," she said, "bear you Larry&mdash;for into your heart the Silent
Ones would look. And fear nothing," she added at the green dwarf's
disconcerted, almost fearful start.
</P>

<P>
Rador bowed, was thrust aside by Olaf.
</P>

<P>
"No," said the Norseman; "I will carry him."
</P>

<P>
He lifted Larry like a child against his broad breast.  The dwarf
glanced quickly at Lakla; she nodded.
</P>

<P>
"Come!" she commanded, and held aside the folds.
</P>

<P>
Of that journey I have few memories.  I only know that we went through
corridor upon corridor; successions of vast halls and chambers, some
carpeted with the rushes, others with rugs into which the feet sank as
into deep, soft meadows; spaces illumined by the rubrous light, and
spaces in which softer lights held sway.
</P>

<P>
We paused before a slab of the same crimson stone as that the green
dwarf had called the portal, and upon its polished surface weaved the
same unnameable symbols. The Golden Girl pressed upon its side; it
slipped softly back; a torrent of opalescence gushed out of the
opening&mdash;and as one in a dream I entered.
</P>

<P>
We were, I knew, just under the dome; but for the moment, caught in
the flood of radiance, I could see nothing. It was like being held
within a fire opal&mdash;so brilliant, so flashing, was it. I closed my
eyes, opened them; the lambency cascaded from the vast curves of the
globular walls; in front of me was a long, narrow opening in them,
through which, far away, I could see the end of the wizards' bridge
and the ledged mouth of the cavern through which we had come; against
the light from within beat the crimson light from without&mdash;and was
checked as though by a barrier.
</P>

<P>
I felt Lakla's touch; turned.
</P>

<P>
A hundred paces away was a dais, its rim raised a yard above the
floor. From the edge of this rim streamed upward a steady, coruscating
mist of the opalescence, veined even as was that of the Dweller's
shining core and shot with milky shadows like curdled moonlight; up it
stretched like a wall.
</P>

<P>
Over it, from it, down upon me, gazed three faces&mdash;two clearly male,
one a woman's. At the first I thought them statues, and then the eyes
of them gave the lie to me; for the eyes were alive, terribly, and if
I could admit the word&mdash;<I>supernaturally</I>&mdash;alive.
</P>

<P>
They were thrice the size of the human eye and triangular, the apex of
the angle upward; black as jet, pupilless, filled with tiny, leaping
red flames.
</P>

<P>
Over them were foreheads, not as ours&mdash;high and broad and visored;
their sides drawn forward into a vertical ridge, a prominence, an
upright wedge, somewhat like the visored heads of a few of the great
lizards&mdash;and the heads, long, narrowing at the back, were fully twice
the size of mankind's!
</P>

<P>
Upon the brows were caps&mdash;and with a fearful certainty I knew that
they were <I>not</I> caps&mdash;long, thick strands of gleaming yellow, feathered
scales thin as sequins! Sharp, curving noses like the beaks of the
giant condors; mouths thin, austere; long, powerful, pointed chins;
the&mdash;<I>flesh</I>&mdash;of the faces white as the whitest marble; and wreathing
up to them, covering all their bodies, the shimmering, curdled, misty
fires of opalescence!
</P>

<P>
Olaf stood rigid; my own heart leaped wildly.  What&mdash;what were these
beings?
</P>

<P>
I forced myself to look again&mdash;and from their gaze streamed a current
of reassurance, of good will&mdash;nay, of intense spiritual strength. I
saw that they were not fierce, not ruthless, not inhuman, despite
their strangeness; no, they were kindly; in some unmistakable way,
benign and sorrowful&mdash;so sorrowful! I straightened, gazed back at them
fearlessly. Olaf drew a deep breath, gazed steadily too, the hardness,
the despair wiped from his face.
</P>

<P>
Now Lakla drew closer to the dais; the three pairs of eyes searched
hers, the woman's with an ineffable tenderness; some message seemed to
pass between the Three and the Golden Girl. She bowed low, turned to
the Norseman.
</P>

<P>
"Place Larry there," she said softly&mdash;"there at the feet of the Silent
Ones."
</P>

<P>
She pointed into the radiant mist; Olaf started, hesitated, stared
from Lakla to the Three, searched for a moment their eyes&mdash;and
something like a smile drifted through them. He stepped forward,
lifted O'Keefe, set him squarely within the covering light. It
wavered, rolled upward, swirled about the body, steadied again&mdash;and
within it there was no sign of Larry!
</P>

<P>
Again the mist wavered, shook, and seemed to climb higher, hiding the
chins, the beaked noses, the brows of that incredible Trinity&mdash;but
before it ceased to climb, I thought the yellow feathered heads bent;
sensed a movement as though they lifted something.
</P>

<P>
The mist fell; the eyes gleamed out again, inscrutable.
</P>

<P>
And groping out of the radiance, pausing at the verge of the dais,
leaping down from it, came Larry, laughing, filled with life, blinking
as one who draws from darkness into sunshine. He saw Lakla, sprang to
her, gripped her in his arms.
</P>

<P>
"Lakla!" he cried. "Mavourneen!"  She slipped from his embrace,
blushing, glancing at the Three shyly, half-fearfully. And again I saw
the tenderness creep into the inky, flame-shot orbs of the woman
being; and a tenderness in the others too&mdash;as though they regarded
some well-beloved child.
</P>

<P>
"You lay in the arms of Death, Larry," she said.  "And the Silent Ones
drew you from him. Do homage to the Silent Ones, Larry, for they are
good and they are mighty!"
</P>

<P>
She turned his head with one of the long, white hands&mdash;and he looked
into the faces of the Three; looked long, was shaken even as had been
Olaf and myself; was swept by that same wave of power and of&mdash;of&mdash;what
can I call it?&mdash;<I>holiness</I> that streamed from them.
</P>

<P>
Then for the first time I saw real awe mount into his face. Another
moment he stared&mdash;and dropped upon one knee and bowed his head before
them as would a worshipper before the shrine of his saint. And&mdash;I am
not ashamed to tell it&mdash;I joined him; and with us knelt Lakla and
Olaf and Rador.
</P>

<P>
The mist of fiery opal swirled up about the Three; hid them.
</P>

<P>
And with a long, deep, joyous sigh Lakla took Larry's hand, drew him
to his feet, and silently we followed them out of that hall of wonder.
</P>

<P>
But why, in going, did the thought come to me that from where the
Three sat throned they ever watched the cavern mouth that was the door
into their abode; and looked down ever into the unfathomable depth in
which glowed and pulsed that mystic flower, colossal, awesome, of
green flame that had seemed to me fire of life itself?
</P>
