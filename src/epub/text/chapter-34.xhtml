</h2>

<P>
The Norseman turned toward us.  There was now no madness in his eyes;
only a great weariness. And there was peace on the once tortured face.
</P>

<P>
"Helma," he whispered, "I go a little before!  Soon you will come to
me&mdash;to me and the Yndling who will await you&mdash;Helma, <I>meine liebe!</I>"
</P>

<P>
Blood gushed from his mouth; he swayed, fell.  And thus died Olaf
Huldricksson.
</P>

<P>
We looked down upon him; nor did Lakla, nor Larry, nor I try to hide
our tears. And as we stood the <I>Akka</I> brought to us that other mighty
fighter, Rador; but in him there was life, and we attended to him
there as best we could.
</P>

<P>
Then Lakla spoke.
</P>

<P>
"We will bear him into the castle where we may give him greater care,"
she said. "For, lo! the hosts of Yolara have been beaten back; and on
the bridge comes Nak with tidings."
</P>

<P>
We looked over the parapet.  It was even as she had said. Neither on
ledge nor bridge was there trace of living men of Muria&mdash;only heaps of
slain that lay everywhere&mdash;and thick against the cavern mouth still
danced the flashing atoms of those the green ray had destroyed.
</P>

<P>
"Over!" exclaimed Larry incredulously.  "We live then&mdash;heart of
mine!"
</P>

<P>
"The Silent Ones recall their veils," she said, pointing to the dome.
Back through the slitted opening the radiance was streaming;
withdrawing from sea and island; marching back over the bridge with
that same ordered, intelligent motion. Behind it the red light
pressed, like skirmishers on the heels of a retreating army.
</P>

<P>
"And yet&mdash;" faltered the handmaiden as we passed into her chamber, and
doubtful were the eyes she turned upon the O'Keefe.
</P>

<P>
"I don't believe," he said, "there's a kick left in them&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
What was that sound beating into the chamber faintly, so faintly?  My
heart gave a great throb and seemed to stop for an eternity. What was
it&mdash;coming nearer, ever nearer? Now Lakla and O'Keefe heard it, life
ebbing from lips and cheeks.
</P>

<P>
Nearer, nearer&mdash;a music as of myriads of tiny crystal bells, tinkling,
tinkling&mdash;a storm of pizzicati upon violins of glass! Nearer,
nearer&mdash;not sweetly now, nor luring; no&mdash;raging, wrathful, sinister
beyond words; sweeping on; nearer&mdash;
</P>

<P>
The Dweller!  The Shining One!
</P>

<P>
We leaped to the narrow window; peered out, aghast.  The bell notes
swept through and about us, a hurricane. The crescent strand was once
more a ferment. Back, back were the <I>Akka</I> being swept, as though by
brooms, tottering on the edge of the ledge, falling into the waters.
Swiftly they were finished; and where they had fought was an eddying
throng clothed in tatters or naked, swaying, drifting, arms
tossing&mdash;like marionettes of Satan.
</P>

<P>
The dead-alive!  The slaves of the Dweller!
</P>

<P>
They swayed and tossed, and then, like water racing through an opened
dam, they swept upon the bridge-head. On and on they pushed, like the
bore of a mighty tide. The frog-men strove against them, clubbing,
spearing, tearing them. But even those worst smitten seemed not to
fall. On they pushed, driving forward, irresistible&mdash;a battering ram
of flesh and bone. They clove the masses of the <I>Akka</I>, pressing them
to the sides of the bridge and over. Through the open gates they
forced them&mdash;for there was no room for the frog-men to stand against
that implacable tide.
</P>

<P>
Then those of the <I>Akka</I> who were left turned their backs and ran.  We
heard the clang of the golden wings of the portal, and none too soon
to keep out the first of the Dweller's dreadful hordes.
</P>

<P>
Now upon the cavern ledge and over the whole length of the bridge
there were none but the dead-alive, men and women, black-polled
<I>ladala</I>, sloe-eyed Malays, slant-eyed Chinese, men of every race that
sailed the seas&mdash;milling, turning, swaying, like leaves caught in a
sluggish current.
</P>

<P>
The bell notes became sharper, more insistent.  At the cavern mouth a
radiance began to grow&mdash;a gleaming from which the atoms of diamond
dust seemed to try to flee. As the radiance grew and the crystal notes
rang nearer, every head of that hideous multitude turned stiffly,
slowly toward the right, looking toward the far bridge end; their eyes
fixed and glaring; every face an inhuman mask of rapture and of
horror!
</P>

<P>
A movement shook them.  Those in the centre began to stream back,
faster and ever faster, leaving motionless deep ranks on each side.
Back they flowed until from golden doors to cavern mouth a wide lane
stretched, walled on each side by the dead-alive.
</P>

<P>
The far radiance became brighter; it gathered itself at the end of the
dreadful lane; it was shot with sparklings and with pulsings of
polychromatic light. The crystal storm was intolerable, piercing the
ears with countless tiny lances; brighter still the radiance.
</P>

<P>
From the cavern swirled the Shining One!
</P>

<P>
The Dweller paused, seemed to scan the island of the Silent Ones half
doubtfully; then slowly, stately, it drifted out upon the bridge.
Closer it drew; behind it glided Yolara at the head of a company of
her dwarfs, and at her side was the hag of the Council whose face was
the withered, shattered echo of her own.
</P>

<P>
Slower grew the Dweller's pace as it drew nearer.  Did I sense in it a
doubt, an uncertainty? The crystal-tongued, unseen choristers that
accompanied it subtly seemed to reflect the doubt; their notes were
not sure, no longer insistent; rather was there in them an undertone
of hesitancy, of warning! Yet on came the Shining One until it stood
plain beneath us, searching with those eyes that thrust from and
withdrew into unknown spheres, the golden gateway, the cliff face, the
castle's rounded bulk&mdash;and more intently than any of these, the dome
wherein sat the Three.
</P>

<P>
Behind it each face of the dead-alive turned toward it, and those
beside it throbbed and gleamed with its luminescence.
</P>

<P>
Yolara crept close, just beyond the reach of its spirals. She
murmured&mdash;and the Dweller bent toward her, its seven globes steady in
their shining mists, as though listening. It drew erect once more,
resumed its doubtful scrutiny. Yolara's face darkened; she turned
abruptly, spoke to a captain of her guards. A dwarf raced back between
the palisades of dead-alive.
</P>

<P>
Now the priestess cried out, her voice ringing like a silver clarion.
</P>

<P>
"Ye are done, ye Three!  The Shining One stands at your door,
demanding entrance. Your beasts are slain and your power is gone. Who
are ye, says the Shining One, to deny it entrance to the place of its
birth?"
</P>

<P>
"Ye do not answer," she cried again, "yet know we that ye hear!  The
Shining One offers these terms: Send forth your handmaiden and that
lying stranger she stole; send them forth to us&mdash;and perhaps ye may
live. But if ye send them not forth, then shall ye too die&mdash;and soon!"
</P>

<P>
We waited, silent, even as did Yolara&mdash;and again there was no answer
from the Three.
</P>

<P>
The priestess laughed; the blue eyes flashed.
</P>

<P>
"It is ended!" she cried.  "If you will not open, needs must we open
for you!"
</P>

<P>
Over the bridge was marching a long double file of the dwarfs.  They
bore a smoothed and handled tree-trunk whose head was knobbed with a
huge ball of metal. Past the priestess, past the Shining One, they
carried it; fifty of them to each side of the ram; and behind them
stepped&mdash;Marakinoff!
</P>

<P>
Larry awoke to life.
</P>

<P>
"Now, thank God," he rasped, "I can get that devil, anyway!"
</P>

<P>
He drew his pistol, took careful aim.  Even as he pressed the trigger
there rang through the abode a tremendous clanging. The ram was
battering at the gates. O'Keefe's bullet went wild. The Russian must
have heard the shot; perhaps the missile was closer than we knew. He
made a swift leap behind the guards; was lost to sight.
</P>

<P>
Once more the thunderous clanging rang through the castle.
</P>

<P>
Lakla drew herself erect; down upon her dropped the listening
aloofness. Gravely she bowed her head.
</P>

<P>
"It is time, O love of mine." She turned to O'Keefe.  "The Silent Ones
say that the way of fear is closed, but the way of love is open. They
call upon us to redeem our promise!"
</P>

<P>
For a hundred heart-beats they clung to each other, breast to breast
and lip to lip. Below, the clangour was increasing, the great trunk
swinging harder and faster upon the metal gates. Now Lakla gently
loosed the arms of the O'Keefe, and for another instant those two
looked into each other's souls. The handmaiden smiled tremulously.
</P>

<P>
"I would it might have been otherwise, Larry darlin'," she whispered.
"But at least&mdash;we pass together, dearest of mine!"
</P>

<P>
She leaped to the window.
</P>

<P>
"Yolara!" the golden voice rang out sweetly.  The clanging ceased.
"Draw back your men. We open the Portal and come forth to you and the
Shining One&mdash;Larry and I."
</P>

<P>
The priestess's silver chimes of laughter rang out, cruel, mocking.
</P>

<P>
"Come, then, quickly," she jeered.  "For surely both the Shining One
and I yearn for you!" Her malice-laden laughter chimed high once more.
"Keep us not lonely long!" the priestess mocked.
</P>

<P>
Larry drew a deep breath, stretched both hands out to me.
</P>

<P>
"It's good-by, I guess, Doc." His voice was strained. "Good-by and
good luck, old boy. If you get out, and you <I>will</I>, let the old
<I>Dolphin</I> know I'm gone. And carry on, pal&mdash;and always remember the
O'Keefe loved you like a brother."
</P>

<P>
I squeezed his hands desperately.  Then out of my balanceshaking woe a
strange comfort was born.
</P>

<P>
"Maybe it's not good-by, Larry!" I cried.  "The banshee has not
cried!"
</P>

<P>
A flash of hope passed over his face; the old reckless grin shone
forth.
</P>

<P>
"It's so!" he said.  "By the Lord, it's so!"
</P>

<P>
Then Lakla bent toward me, and for the second time&mdash;kissed me.
</P>

<P>
"Come!" she said to Larry.  Hand in hand they moved away, into the
corridor that led to the door outside of which waited the Shining One
and its priestess.
</P>

<P>
And unseen by them, wrapped as they were within their love and
sacrifice, I crept softly behind. For I had determined that if enter
the Dweller's embrace they must, they should not go alone.
</P>

<P>
They paused before the Golden Portals; the handmaiden pressed its
opening lever; the massive leaves rolled back.
</P>

<P>
Heads high, proudly, serenely, they passed through and out upon the
hither span. I followed.
</P>

<P>
On each side of us stood the Dweller's slaves, faces turned rigidly
toward their master. A hundred feet away the Shining One pulsed and
spiralled in its evilly glorious lambency of sparkling plumes.
</P>

<P>
Unhesitating, always with that same high serenity, Lakla and the
O'Keefe, hands clasped like little children, drew closer to that
wondrous shape. I could not see their faces, but I saw awe fall upon
those of the watching dwarfs, and into the burning eyes of Yolara
crept a doubt. Closer they drew to the Dweller, and closer, I
following them step by step. The Shining One's whirling lessened; its
tinklings were faint, almost stilled. It seemed to watch them
apprehensively. A silence fell upon us all, a thick silence, brooding,
ominous, palpable. Now the pair were face to face with the child of
the Three&mdash;so near that with one of its misty tentacles it could have
enfolded them.
</P>

<P>
And the Shining One drew back!
</P>

<P>
Yes, drew back&mdash;and back with it stepped Yolara, the doubt in her eyes
deepening. Onward paced the handmaiden and the O'Keefe&mdash;and step by
step, as they advanced, the Dweller withdrew; its bell notes chiming
out, puzzled questioning&mdash;half fearful!
</P>

<P>
And back it drew, and back until it had reached the very centre of
that platform over the abyss in whose depths pulsed the green fires of
earth heart. And there Yolara gripped herself; the hell that seethed
within her soul leaped out of her eyes, a cry, a shriek of rage, tore
from her lips.
</P>

<P>
As at a signal, the Shining One flamed high; its spirals and eddying
mists swirled madly, the pulsing core of it blazed radiance. A score
of coruscating tentacles swept straight upon the pair who stood
intrepid, unresisting, awaiting its embrace. And upon me, lurking
behind them.
</P>

<P>
Through me swept a mighty exaltation.  It was the end then&mdash;and I was
to meet it with them.
</P>

<P>
Something drew us back, back with an incredible swiftness, and yet as
gently as a summer breeze sweeps a bit of thistle-down! Drew us back
from those darting misty arms even as they were a hair-breadth from
us! I heard the Dweller's bell notes burst out ragingly! I heard
Yolara scream.
</P>

<P>
What was that?
</P>

<P>
Between the three of us and them was a ring of curdled moon flames,
swirling about the Shining One and its priestess, pressing in upon
them, enfolding them!
</P>

<P>
And within it I glimpsed the faces of the Three&mdash;implacable,
sorrowful, filled with a supernal power!
</P>

<P>
Sparks and flashes of white flame darted from the ring, penetrating
the radiant swathings of the Dweller, striking through its pulsing
nucleus, piercing its seven crowning orbs.
</P>

<P>
Now the Shining One's radiance began to dim, the seven orbs to dull;
the tiny sparkling filaments that ran from them down into the
Dweller's body snapped, vanished! Through the battling nebulosities
Yolara's face swam forth&mdash;horror-filled, distorted, inhuman!
</P>

<P>
The ranks of the dead-alive quivered, moved, writhed, as though each
felt the torment of the Thing that had enslaved them. The radiance
that the Three wielded grew more intense, thicker, seemed to expand.
Within it, suddenly, were scores of flaming triangles&mdash;scores of eyes
like those of the Silent Ones!
</P>

<P>
And the Shining One's seven little moons of amber, of silver, of blue
and amethyst and green, of rose and white, split, shattered, were
gone! Abruptly the tortured crystal chimings ceased.
</P>

<P>
Dulled, all its soul-shaking beauty dead, blotched and shadowed
squalidly, its gleaming plumes tarnished, its dancing spirals stripped
from it, that which had been the Shining One wrapped itself about
Yolara&mdash;wrapped and drew her into itself; writhed, swayed, and hurled
itself over the edge of the bridge&mdash;down, down into the green fires of
the unfathomable abyss&mdash;with its priestess still enfolded in its
coils!
</P>

<P>
From the dwarfs who had watched that terror came screams of panic
fear. They turned and ran, racing frantically over the bridge toward
the cavern mouth.
</P>

<P>
The serried ranks of the dead-alive trembled, shook.  Then from their
faces tied the horror of wedded ecstasy and anguish. Peace, utter
peace, followed in its wake.
</P>

<P>
And as fields of wheat are bent and fall beneath the wind, they fell.
No longer dead-alive, now all of the blessed dead, freed from their
dreadful slavery!
</P>

<P>
Abruptly from the sparkling mists the cloud of eyes was gone.  Faintly
revealed in them were only the heads of the Silent Ones. And they drew
before us; were before us! No flames now in their ebon eyes&mdash;for the
flickering fires were quenched in great tears, streaming down the
marble white faces. They bent toward us, over us; their radiance
enfolded us. My eyes darkened. I could not see. I felt a tender hand
upon my head&mdash;and panic and frozen dread and nightmare web that held
me fled.
</P>

<P>
Then they, too, were gone.
</P>

<P>
Upon Larry's breast the handmaiden was sobbing&mdash;sobbing out her
heart&mdash;but this time with the joy of one who is swept up from the
very threshold of hell into paradise.
</P>
