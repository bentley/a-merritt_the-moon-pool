</h2>

<P>
It is with marked hesitation that I begin this chapter, because in it
I must deal with an experience so contrary to every known law of
physics as to seem impossible. Until this time, barring, of course,
the mystery of the Dweller, I had encountered nothing that was not
susceptible of naturalistic explanation; nothing, in a word, outside
the domain of science itself; nothing that I would have felt hesitancy
in reciting to my colleagues of the International Association of
Science. Amazing, unfamiliar&mdash;<I>advanced</I>&mdash;as many of the phenomena were,
still they lay well within the limits of what we have mapped as the
possible; in regions, it is true, still virgin to the mind of man, but
toward which that mind is steadily advancing.
</P>

<P>
But this&mdash;well, I confess that I have a theory that is naturalistic;
but so abstruse, so difficult to make clear within the short confines
of the space I have to give it, so dependent upon conceptions that
even the highest-trained scientific brains find difficult to grasp,
that I despair.
</P>

<P>
I can only say that the thing occurred; that it took place in
precisely the manner I am about to narrate, and that I experienced it.
</P>

<P>
Yet, in justice to myself, I must open up some paths of preliminary
approach toward the heart of the perplexity. And the first path is the
realization that our world <I>whatever</I> it is, is certainly <I>not</I> the
world as we see it! Regarding this I shall refer to a discourse upon
"Gravitation and the Principle of Relativity," by the distinguished
English physicist, Dr. A. S. Eddington, which I had the pleasure of
hearing him deliver before the Royal Institution.[1]
</P>

<P>
I realize, of course, that it is not true logic to argue&mdash;"The world
is not as we think it is&mdash;therefore everything we think impossible is
possible in it." Even if it <I>be</I> different, it is governed by <I>law</I>. The
truly impossible is that which is outside law, and as nothing <I>can</I> be
outside law, the impossible <I>cannot</I> exist.
</P>

<P>
The crux of the matter then becomes our determination whether what we
think is impossible may or may not be possible under laws still beyond
our knowledge.
</P>

<P>
I hope that you will pardon me for this somewhat academic digression,
but I felt it was necessary, and it has, at least, put me more at
ease. And now to resume.
</P>

<P>
We had watched, Larry and I, the frog-men throw the bodies of Yolara's
assassins into the crimson waters. As vultures swoop down upon the
dying, there came sailing swiftly to where the dead men floated,
dozens of the luminous globes. Their slender, varicoloured tentacles
whipped out; the giant iridescent bubbles <I>climbed</I> over the cadavers.
And as they touched them there was the swift dissolution, the melting
away into putrescence of flesh and bone that I had witnessed when the
dart touched fruit that time I had saved Rador&mdash;and upon this the
Medusae gorged; pulsing lambently; their wondrous colours shifting,
changing, glowing stronger; elfin moons now indeed, but satellites
whose glimmering beauty was fed by death; alembics of enchantment
whose glorious hues were sucked from horror.
</P>

<P>
Sick, I turned away&mdash;O'Keefe as pale as I; passed back into the
corridor that had opened on the ledge from which we had watched; met
Lakla hurrying toward us. Before she could speak there throbbed
faintly about us a vast sighing. It grew into a murmur, a whispering,
shook us&mdash;then passing like a presence, died away in far distance.
</P>

<P>
"The Portal has opened," said the handmaiden.  A fainter sighing, like
an echo of the other, mourned about us. "Yolara is gone," she said,
"the Portal is closed. Now must we hasten&mdash;for the Three have
commanded that you, Goodwin, and Larry and I tread that strange road
of which I have spoken, and which Olaf may not take lest his heart
break&mdash;and we must return ere he and Rador cross the bridge."
</P>

<P>
Her hand sought Larry's.
</P>

<P>
"Come!" said Lakla, and we walked on; down and down through hall after
hall, flight upon flight of stairways. Deep, deep indeed, we must be
beneath the domed castle&mdash;Lakla paused before a curved, smooth breast
of the crimson stone rounding gently into the passage. She pressed its
side; it revolved; we entered; it closed behind us.
</P>

<P>
The room, the&mdash;hollow&mdash;in which we stood was faceted like a diamond;
and like a cut brilliant its sides glistened&mdash;though dully. Its shape
was a deep oval, and our path dropped down to a circular polished
base, roughly two yards in diameter. Glancing behind me I saw that in
the closing of the entrance there had been left no trace of it save
the steps that led from where that entrance had been&mdash;and as I looked
these steps <I>turned</I>, leaving us isolated upon the circle, only the
faceted walls about us&mdash;and in each of the gleaming faces the three of
us reflected&mdash;dimly. It was as though we were within a diamond egg
whose graven angles had been turned <I>inward</I>.
</P>

<P>
But the oval was not perfect; at my right a screen cut it&mdash;a screen
that gleamed with fugitive, fleeting luminescences&mdash;stretching from
the side of our standing place up to the tip of the chamber; slightly
convex and crisscrossed by millions of fine lines like those upon a
spectroscopic plate, but with this difference&mdash;that within each line I
sensed the presence of multitudes of finer lines, dwindling into
infinitude, ultramicroscopic, traced by some instrument compared to
whose delicacy our finest tool would be as a crowbar to the needle of
a micrometer.
</P>

<P>
A foot or two from it stood something like the standee of a compass,
bearing, like it a cradled dial under whose crystal ran concentric
rings of prisoned, lambent vapours, faintly blue. From the edge of the
dial jutted a little shelf of crystal, a keyboard, in which were cut
eight small cups.
</P>

<P>
Within these cups the handmaiden placed her tapering fingers.  She
gazed down upon the disk; pressed a digit&mdash;and the screen behind us
slipped noiselessly into another angle.
</P>

<P>
"Put your arm around my waist, Larry, darlin', and stand close," she
murmured. "You, Goodwin, place your arm over my shoulder."
</P>

<P>
Wondering, I did as she bade; she pressed other fingers upon the
shelf's indentations&mdash;three of the rings of vapour spun into intense
light, raced around each other; from the screen behind us grew a
radiance that held within itself all spectrums&mdash;not only those seen,
but those <I>unseen</I> by man's eyes. It waxed brilliant and ever more
brilliant, all suffusing, passing through me as day streams through a
window pane!
</P>

<P>
The enclosing facets burst into a blaze of coruscations, and in each
sparkling panel I saw our images, shaken and torn like pennants in a
whirlwind. I turned to look&mdash;was stopped by the handmaiden's swift
command: "Turn not&mdash;on your life!"
</P>

<P>
The radiance behind me grew; was a rushing tempest of light in which I
was but the shadow of a shadow. I heard, but not with my ears&mdash;nay with
<I>mind</I> itself&mdash;a vast roaring; an <I>ordered</I> tumult of sound that came
hurling from the outposts of space; approaching&mdash;rushing&mdash;hurricane
out of the heart of the cosmos&mdash;closer, closer. It wrapped itself
about us with unearthly mighty arms.
</P>

<P>
And brilliant, ever more brilliant, streamed the radiance through us.
</P>

<P>
The faceted walls dimmed; in front of me they melted, diaphanously,
like a gelatinous wall in a blast of flame; through their vanishing,
under the torrent of driving light, the unthinkable, impalpable
tornado, I began to move, slowly&mdash;then ever more swiftly!
</P>

<P>
Still the roaring grew; the radiance streamed&mdash;ever faster we went.
Cutting down through the length, the <I>extension</I> of me, dropped a wall
of rock, foreshortened, clenched close; I caught a glimpse of the
elfin gardens; they whirled, contracted, into a thin&mdash;slice&mdash;of colour
that was a part of me; another wall of rock shrinking into a thin
wedge through which I flew, and that at once took its place within me
like a card slipped beside those others!
</P>

<P>
Flashing around me, and from Lakla and O'Keefe, were nimbuses of
flickering scarlet flames. And always the steady hurling
forward&mdash;appallingly mechanical.
</P>

<P>
Another barrier of rock&mdash;a gleam of white waters incorporating
themselves into my&mdash;<I>drawing out</I>&mdash;even as were the flowered moss lands,
the slicing, rocky walls&mdash;still another rampart of cliff, dwindling
instantly into the vertical plane of those others. Our flight checked;
we seemed to hover within, then to sway onward&mdash;slowly, cautiously.
</P>

<P>
A mist danced ahead of me&mdash;a mist that grew steadily thinner.  We
stopped, wavered&mdash;the mist cleared.
</P>

<P>
I looked out into translucent, green distances; shot with swift
prismatic gleamings; waves and pulsings of luminosity like midday sun
glow through green, tropic waters: dancing, scintillating veils of
sparkling atoms that flew, hither and yon, through depths of nebulous
splendour!
</P>

<P>
And Lakla and Larry and I were, I saw, like shadow shapes upon a
smooth breast of stone twenty feet or more above the surface of this
place&mdash;a surface spangled with tiny white blossoms gleaming wanly
through creeping veils of phosphorescence like smoke of moon fire. We
were shadows&mdash;and yet we had substance; we were incorporated with, a
part of, the rock&mdash;and yet we were living flesh and blood; we
stretched&mdash;nor will I qualify this&mdash;we <I>stretched</I> through mile upon
mile of space that weirdly enough gave at one and the same time an
absolute certainty of immense horizontal lengths and a vertical
concentration that contained nothing of length, nothing of space
whatever; we stood <I>there</I> upon the face of the stone&mdash;and still we
were <I>here</I> within the faceted oval before the screen of radiance!
</P>

<P>
"Steady!" It was Lakla's voice&mdash;and not beside me <I>there</I>, but at my ear
close before the screen. "Steady, Goodwin! And&mdash;see!"
</P>

<P>
The sparkling haze cleared.  Enormous reaches stretched before me.
Shimmering up through them, and as though growing in some medium
thicker than air, was mass upon mass of verdure&mdash;fruiting trees and
trees laden with pale blossoms, arbours and bowers of pallid blooms,
like that sea fruit of oblivion&mdash;grapes of Lethe&mdash;that cling to the
tide-swept walls of the caverns of the Hebrides.
</P>

<P>
Through them, beyond them, around and about them, drifted and eddied a
horde&mdash;great as that with which Tamerlane swept down upon Rome, vast
as the myriads which Genghis Khan rolled upon the califs&mdash;men and
women and children&mdash;clothed in tatters, half nude and wholly naked;
slant-eyed Chinese, sloe-eyed Malays, islanders black and brown and
yellow, fierce-faced warriors of the Solomons with grizzled locks
fantastically bedizened; Papuans, feline Javans, Dyaks of hill and
shore; hook-nosed Phoenicians, Romans, straight-browed Greeks, and
Vikings centuries <I>beyond</I> their lives: scores of the black-haired
Murians; white faces of our own Westerners&mdash;men and women and
children&mdash;drifting, eddying&mdash;each stamped with that mingled horror and
rapture, eyes filled with ecstasy and terror entwined, marked by God
and devil in embrace&mdash;the seal of the Shining One&mdash;the dead-alive; the
lost ones!
</P>

<P>
The loot of the Dweller!
</P>

<P>
Soul-sick, I gazed.  They lifted to us visages of dread; they swept
down toward us, glaring upward&mdash;a bank against which other and still
other waves of faces rolled, were checked, paused; until as far as I
could see, like billows piled upon an ever-growing barrier, they
stretched beneath us&mdash;staring&mdash;staring!
</P>

<P>
Now there was a movement&mdash;far, far away; a concentrating of the
lambency; the dead-alive swayed, oscillated, separated&mdash;forming a long
lane against whose outskirts they crowded with avid, hungry
insistence.
</P>

<P>
First only a luminous cloud, then a whirling pillar of splendours
through the lane came&mdash;the Shining One. As it passed, the dead-alive
swirled in its wake like leaves behind a whirlwind, eddying, twisting;
and as the Dweller raced by them, brushing them with its spirallings
and tentacles, they shone forth with unearthly, awesome
gleamings&mdash;like vessels of alabaster in which wicks flare suddenly.
And when it had passed they closed behind it, staring up at us once
more.
</P>

<P>
The Dweller paused beneath us.
</P>

<P>
Out of the drifting ruck swam the body of Throckmartin! Throckmartin,
my friend, to find whom I had gone to the pallid moon door; my friend
whose call I had so laggardly followed. On his face was the Dweller's
dreadful stamp; the lips were bloodless; the eyes were wide, lucent,
something like pale, phosphorescence gleaming within them&mdash;and
soulless.
</P>

<P>
He stared straight up at me, unwinking, unrecognizing. Pressing
against his side was a woman, young and gentle, and lovely&mdash;lovely
even through the mask that lay upon her face. And her wide eyes, like
Throckmartin's, glowed with the lurking, unholy fires. She pressed
against him closely; though the hordes kept up the faint churning,
these two kept ever together, as though bound by unseen fetters.
</P>

<P>
And I knew the girl for Edith, his wife, who in vain effort to save
him had cast herself into the Dweller's embrace!
</P>

<P>
"Throckmartin!" I cried.  "Throckmartin!  I'm here!"
</P>

<P>
Did he hear?  I know now, of course, he could not.
</P>

<P>
But then I waited&mdash;hope striving to break through the nightmare hands
that gripped my heart.
</P>

<P>
Their wide eyes never left me.  There was another movement about them,
others pushed past them; they drifted back, swaying, eddying&mdash;and
still staring were lost in the awful throng.
</P>

<P>
Vainly I strained my gaze to find them again, to force some sign of
recognition, some awakening of the clean life we know. But they were
gone. Try as I would I could not see them&mdash;nor Stanton and the
northern woman named Thora who had been the first of that tragic party
to be taken by the Dweller.
</P>

<P>
"Throckmartin!" I cried again, despairingly.  My tears blinded me.
</P>

<P>
I felt Lakla's light touch.
</P>

<P>
"Steady," she commanded, pitifully.  "Steady, Goodwin. You cannot help
them&mdash;now! Steady and&mdash;watch!"
</P>

<P>
Below us the Shining One had paused&mdash;spiralling, swirling, vibrant
with all its transcendent, devilish beauty; had paused and was
contemplating us. Now I could see clearly that nucleus, that core shot
through with flashing veins of radiance, that ever-shifting shape of
glory through the shroudings of shimmering, misty plumes, throbbing
lacy opalescences, vaporous spirallings of prismatic phantom fires.
Steady over it hung the seven little moons of amethyst, of saffron, of
emerald and azure and silver, of rose of life and moon white. They
poised themselves like a diadem&mdash;calm, serene, immobile&mdash;and down
from them into the Dweller, piercing plumes and swirls and spirals,
ran countless tiny strands, radiations, finer than the finest spun
thread of spider's web, gleaming filaments through which seemed to
run&mdash;<I>power</I>&mdash;from the seven globes; like&mdash;yes, that was it&mdash;miniatures
of the seven torrents of moon flame that poured through the
septichromatic, high crystals in the Moon Pool's chamber roof.
</P>

<P>
Swam out of the coruscating haze the&mdash;face!
</P>

<P>
Both of man and of woman it was&mdash;like some ancient, androgynous deity
of Etruscan fanes long dust, and yet neither woman nor man; human and
unhuman, seraphic and sinister, benign and malefic&mdash;and still no more
of these four than is flame, which is beautiful whether it warms or
devours, or wind whether it feathers the trees or shatters them, or
the wave which is wondrous whether it caresses or kills.
</P>

<P>
Subtly, undefinably it was of our world and of one not ours.  Its
lineaments flowed from another sphere, took fleeting familiar
form&mdash;and as swiftly withdrew whence they had come; something
amorphous, unearthly&mdash;as of unknown unheeding, unseen gods rushing
through the depths of star-hung space; and still of our own earth,
with the very soul of earth peering out from it, caught within it&mdash;and
in some&mdash;unholy&mdash;way debased.
</P>

<P>
It had eyes&mdash;eyes that were now only shadows darkening within its
luminosity like veils falling, and falling, <I>opening</I> windows into the
unknowable; deepening into softly glowing blue pools, blue as the Moon
Pool itself; then flashing out, and this only when the&mdash;face&mdash;bore its
most human resemblance, into twin stars large almost as the crown of
little moons; and with that same baffling suggestion of peep-holes
into a world untrodden, alien, perilous to man!
</P>

<P>
"Steady!" came Lakla's voice, her body leaned against mine.
</P>

<P>
I gripped myself, my brain steadied, I looked again.  And I saw that
of body, at least body as we know it, the Shining One had
none&mdash;nothing but the throbbing, pulsing core streaked with lightning
veins of rainbows; and around this, never still, sheathing it, the
swirling, glorious veilings of its hell and heaven born radiance.
</P>

<P>
So the Dweller stood&mdash;and gazed.
</P>

<P>
Then up toward us swept a reaching, questing spiral!
</P>

<P>
Under my hand Lakla's shoulder quivered; dead-alive and their master
vanished&mdash;I danced, flickered, <I>within</I> the rock; felt a swift sense of
shrinking, of withdrawal; slice upon slice the carded walls of stone,
of silvery waters, of elfin gardens slipped from me as cards are
withdrawn from a pack, one by one&mdash;slipped, wheeled, flattened, and
lengthened out as I passed through them and they passed from me.
</P>

<P>
Gasping, shaken, weak, I stood within the faceted oval chamber; arm
still about the handmaiden's white shoulder; Larry's hand still
clutching her girdle.
</P>

<P>
The roaring, impalpable gale from the cosmos was retreating to the
outposts of space&mdash;was still; the intense, streaming, flooding
radiance lessened&mdash;died.
</P>

<P>
"Now have you beheld," said Lakla, "and well you trod the road.  And
now shall you hear, even as the Silent Ones have commanded, what the
Shining One is&mdash;and how it came to be."
</P>

<P>
The steps flashed back; the doorway into the chamber opened.
</P>

<P>
Larry as silent as I&mdash;we followed her through it.
</P>
